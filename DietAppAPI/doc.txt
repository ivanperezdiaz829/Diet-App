****DOCUMENTATION FOR USER API****

-How to use it:
Launch server using main.py and the server Will run in http://localhost:8000 (server URL). To use endpoints in browser or app, use endpoint URL (server URL + / + endpoint). Take note that different endpoints use different HTTP request methods. Postman is a great way to test API functionallities, here is the link to postman workspace: https://app.getpostman.com/join-team?invite_code=d1f7709daab703ff94b39a85c6215bd5c28fbe173bbf7fc23dfc15b01e9d2b15&target_code=2495c086ad078b5d9b8bbae0000e9c12
